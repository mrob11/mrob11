# Hey, I’m Mike 👋

I'm a full-stack web developer and technical lead focused on building scalable systems, intuitive user experiences, and developer tooling that makes teams faster and happier.

I work across the stack — from React and Next.js on the front end to TypeScript, Python, and PostgreSQL on the back end. I’ve architected internal platforms, led front-end transformations, and shipped high-concurrency web apps used by tens of thousands of users.

I'm especially interested in:
- Clean, modular architecture
- Developer experience and tooling
- Content platforms and CMS design
- Privacy-first home automation
- Music tech and creative coding

🛠️ **Tech I'm into lately**  
`Next.js` • `TypeScript` • `Django` • `PostgreSQL` • `Supabase` • `Astro` • `Vercel` • `Home Assistant`

🎸 **Outside of code**  
I play guitar in a local band, build way too many DIY projects, and tinker with home automation and 3D printing. I live in London, Ontario with my family and our chocolate lab, Ellie.
